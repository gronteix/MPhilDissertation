# MPhilDissertation

The repository with the full, commented, code for my MPhil project.

The algorithm is structured in three distinct parts:

  1) Image segmentation
  2) Feature extraction
  3) Post processing
  
For simplicity's sake, and due to the numerous minor parameter adjustments necessary, we use Jupter Notebook as the
main interface from which we call all other functions.
